# PyTorch Deep Learning Image Classifier

Code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application

# Install

### To install, simply download the files `train.py` , `predict.py` , `funcs_n_classes.py` , and `predict_funcs_n_classes.py` and place them in the same folder.

# Usage

In general, the usage of this program consists of training the neural network model on classifications, and then supplying a new unseen image for it to predict and classify the image.

### The Project has 2 main files that you will call: `train.py` and `predict.py`

### Training the model

The program accommodates takes the following input and options:

`usage: train.py [-h] [DATA_DIR] [--save_dir SAVE_DIR] [--arch ARCH]
                [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE] [--hidden_units HIDDEN_UNITS]
                [--epochs EPOCHS] [--gpu GPU]`
